- ✅ Working homepage
- ✅ Responsive navigation
- ✅ Modern styling
- ✅ Development server running
- ✅ Error-free compilation

## 🔧 What Still Needs to be Done

### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1 Completion):
1. **Environment Setup** - Create `.env.local` with actual Supabase credentials
2. **Database Setup** - Run the database schema migrations
3. **Storage Setup** - Create Supabase storage buckets for images/files

### Phase 2 Priority Items:
1. **Navigation Component** - Create header with menu for all pages
2. **Authentication Pages** - Build login/logout functionality
3. **Basic Page Structure** - Create placeholder pages for:
   - `/announcements`
   - `/daily-notice`
   - `/events`
   - `/gallery`
   - `/staff`
   - `/downloads`
   - `/contact`

## 🚀 How to Continue Development

### Option 1: Complete Phase 1
```bash
# Set up Supabase project and get credentials
# Create .env.local file
# Run database migrations
```

### Option 2: Start Phase 2
```bash
# Create navigation component
# Build basic page layouts
# Implement routing structure
```

### Option 3: Focus on Admin Panel
```bash
# Create admin login system
# Build admin dashboard
# Implement content management
```

## 📝 Technical Notes

- **Tailwind CSS**: Working properly with custom color scheme
- **Component Library**: Shadcn/ui components ready to use
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety implemented
- **File Structure**: Following Next.js 13+ App Router best practices
- **Performance**: Optimized with Turbopack for fast development

## 🎯 Recommendation

I recommend **completing Phase 1** by setting up the Supabase database, then moving to **Phase 2** to create the basic page structure and navigation. This will give you a solid foundation before diving into the admin panel functionality.
